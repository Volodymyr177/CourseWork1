# Real Estate Project

## Project Overview

This project is a real estate management system that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete property listings. The system also includes functionality for user registration and login.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories: controller, model, and view.

- controller: Contains the business logic for handling user interactions and updating the model.
- model: Contains the data access logic, including interactions with IndexedDB.
- view: Contains the user interface components and rendering logic.
